# SQL Test

SQL scripts were created for PostgreSQL. These can be imported and executed in a database manager.

----


If you need a database you can run the following command for docker.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will create a new PostgreSQL database on port `9001`.

*Do not forget to create the `.env` file as shown in `.env_example`*
